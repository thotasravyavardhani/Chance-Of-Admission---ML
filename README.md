Chance Of Admission Prediction - Machine learning Project

Chance of Admission for Higher Studies Predict the chances of admission of a student to a Graduate program based on:

GRE Scores (290 to 340)
TOEFL Scores (92 to 120)
University Rating (1 to 5)
Statement of Purpose (1 to 5)
Letter of Recommendation Strength (1 to 5)
Undergraduate CGPA (6.8 to 9.92)
Research Experience (0 or 1)
Chance of Admit (0.34 to 0.97)

Steps to create a ML model:

import library

import data

Select X and Y (Dependent or o/p variable(Y) and Independent or i/p variable(X)).

Train Test Split: Splitting the data into Train data and Test data Train data is used to Train the ML model and test data is used to by taking random samples from dataset.

Select model : based on Y- o/p variable type if y = Continuous data - Regression models if y = Categorical data (0 / 1,T/ F)- Classification models

Regression models:

a. if y depends only on one of the other Variable (x) then eq-> y=mx+c b. if y depends on multiple then eq-> y=b0+b1x1+b2x2+.... use LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL Not only these their can be many other chance

Classification models:

Clustering, Naive Buyes....

Training or fitting the model

Testing or predicting the model

Accuracy check
